## Application Building Context

Read the following files in order before implementing or making any architectural decision:

1. `context/project-overview.md` — product definition, roles, and scope
2. `context/architecture.md` — system structure, boundaries, storage model, and invariants
3. `context/code-standards.md` — implementation rules and conventions
4. `context/ai-workflow-rules.md` — development workflow, scoping rules, and delivery approach
5. `context/progress-tracker.md` — current state, recent activity, and open questions

Update `context/progress-tracker.md` after each meaningful implementation change.

If implementation changes the architecture, scope, or standards documented in the context files, update the relevant file before continuing.

New backend feature work is planned as a numbered spec under `context/specs/` — see `context/specs/00-build-plan.md`.

This repo is one half of a two-repo product (`reiment-l2-server` + `reiment-l2-client`, see the root `CLAUDE.md` one level up) — treat cross-repo changes as two separate edits, never assume shared code or types.
